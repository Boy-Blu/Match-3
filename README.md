# Match-3
A match 3 game, Tiles drop on a grid, match 3 that are together and of the same colour/shape, Simple game.

Curently two modes exist, Click Match and Chain Match. The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. To play We impose two rules dependent on the rule selected.

<h1>Click Match<\h1>
  In this mode, the user clicks on a group of tiles in a group of size two or more. Groups are defined by a set of tiles connected by the basic 4 cardinal directions.
<h1>Chain Match<\h1>  
  In this mode, the user makes a chain of matches, starting at any tile, the user slowly connects a chain set of tiles, tiles that are next to each other in the 8 cardinal directions.

Due to time constraints, we are putting the project on hold. The team is currently composed of university student and have decided it would be best to focus on studies for a bit.

With the above mentioned, to swap mode, go into the Board file and swap the strategy within the constructor, we know this is bad design, Only implemented with the time constraint we had.
